## General info
The challenge of the hackathon was to focus on a social issue that related to post COVID19. We focused on the issue of social distancing and the need for proper health care during this time. MediX is a web application that helps patients find and receive the medication they need while maintaining Social Distancing during and post COVID19. It did this by simply searching the locations for the medication a patient needs and gives options to remotely delivery or pickup the medication nearest to them so that it reduces the need to travel outside but also travel outside less to improve social distancing.
